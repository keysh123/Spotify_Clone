# Spotify_Clone
A responsive and modern frontend clone of Spotify built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. This project replicates the look and feel of the Spotify web player, including components like the sidebar, navigation bar, playlists, and a song display interface. This is a frontend-only implementation â€” no backend or actual music streaming functionality.
